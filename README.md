# Soil-mapping
This project is an interactive soil nutrient mapping and visualization system designed to analyze and display soil fertility data across different regions using a map-based interface. It integrates Leaflet.js, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON data to provide users with an intuitive way to explore soil health parameters.

The system loads real soil test data (including Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Sulphur, Zinc, Iron, Copper, Boron, Manganese, pH, Electrical Conductivity, and Organic Carbon) from a JSON dataset and plots them as location-based markers on an interactive map. Each marker represents a specific location and, when clicked, displays the detailed soil composition of that area.

Users can interact with the application through dynamic sliders that allow filtering of map markers based on nutrient levels. This feature helps users identify regions with specific soil nutrient concentrations, making it useful for agricultural planning, soil analysis, and decision-making in precision farming.

The project demonstrates the integration of data visualization with geographic information systems (GIS) to provide a powerful analytical tool for environmental and agricultural applications.
